### 12 Flowers Survival and Neighbor Reliability {data-difficulty="2"}

You ask your neighbor to water your flowers while you are on vacation. If the flowers are watered, they have about 0.85 chance of survival; otherwise, they will only survive with probability 0.2. You are 90 percent sure your neighbor will water the flowers, but when you are back, you see the flowers didn't survive. What is the probability your neighbor didn't water the flowers? Should you trust her anymore?

- a) Yesterday she was late. What is the probability she took the bus?
- b) Today she was on time. Do you think she walked?
