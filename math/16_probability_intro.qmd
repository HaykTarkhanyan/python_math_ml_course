- a) Yesterday she was late. What is the probability she took the bus?
- b) Today she was on time. Do you think she walked?

### 15 Two-Headed Coin Bayes {data-difficulty="2"}

Rosie has ten coins. Nine of them are ordinary coins with equal chances of Heads and Tails when tossed, and the tenth has two Heads.

- a) If she takes one of the coins at random from her pocket, what is the probability that it is the coin with two Heads?
- b) If she tosses the coin and it comes up Heads, what is the probability that it is the coin with two Heads?
- c) If she tosses the coin one further time and it comes up Tails, what is the probability that it is one of the nine ordinary coins?
### 16 Medical Test (Bayes’ Theorem) {data-difficulty="2"}

A disease affects 1 in 1,000 people (0.1%). A test has: true positive rate 99% (if diseased), false positive rate 5% (if healthy). If a person tests positive, what is the probability they actually have the disease?

### 17 Two Children: Conditional Probabilities {data-difficulty="2"}

Consider a family that has two children. The sample space of genders is S = {(G,G), (G,B), (B,G), (B,B)} where G denotes a girl and B a boy, and all outcomes are equally likely.

- a) What is the probability that both children are girls, given that the first child is a girl?
- b) Suppose the father answers “Yes” to “Do you have at least one daughter?”. Given this information, what is the probability that both children are girls?

### 18 Two Children, One Named Lilia {data-difficulty="2"}

A family has two children. We ask the father: “Do you have at least one daughter named Lilia?”, and he replies “Yes.” What is the probability that both children are girls?

Assume:

- If a child is a girl, her name is Lilia with probability $\\alpha < 1$, independently of other children’s names.
- If the child is a boy, his name will not be Lilia.

- A hits with probability 0.3
- B hits with probability 1 (never misses)
- C hits with probability 0.5
