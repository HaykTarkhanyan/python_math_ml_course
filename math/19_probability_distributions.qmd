## Distribution Identification

### 01 Distribution detective: Which one fits? {data-difficulty="2"}

Match each scenario to the most appropriate distribution. Justify each choice in one sentence.

- a) The number of typos on a randomly selected page of a 500-page book, if typos occur randomly at an average rate of 0.5 per page.
- b) Whether a randomly selected email is spam (yes/no), given 40% of emails are spam.
- c) The number of heads in 20 coin flips.
- d) The exact time (in minutes) you wait for the next bus, if buses arrive completely randomly at an average rate of 4 per hour.
- e) A randomly chosen real number between 0 and 10.

---

### 02 Name that distribution {data-difficulty="2"}

For each scenario, identify the distribution, state its parameter(s), and write the PMF or PDF.

- a) A call center receives calls at an average rate of 8 per hour. Let $X$ be the number of calls received between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM.
- b) A software update crashes with probability 0.03. An IT department pushes the update to 200 computers independently. Let $Y$ be the number of computers that crash.
- c) A sensor measures temperature continuously, but due to manufacturing imprecision, the true reading is somewhere between 98.5°C and 101.5°C with no value more likely than another. Let $T$ be the measured temperature.
- d) A quality inspector tests light bulbs one by one. Each bulb independently fails inspection with probability 0.15. Let $N$ be the number of bulbs tested until the first failure.
- e) The time between earthquakes in a seismically active region averages 4 months. Let $W$ be the waiting time (in months) until the next earthquake.

### 03 Mystery distributions: Identify from data {data-difficulty="3"}

A researcher collects data from three different experiments and computes summary statistics:

**Dataset A:** $n = 500$ observations, all values are either 0 or 1. Sample mean $\approx 0.23$, sample variance $\approx 0.177$.

**Dataset B:** $n = 1000$ observations, values range from 0 to 47. Sample mean $\approx 12.1$, sample variance $\approx 11.8$.

**Dataset C:** $n = 800$ observations, values are positive reals ranging from 0.001 to 14.2. Sample mean $\approx 2.5$, sample variance $\approx 6.3$.

For each dataset:

- a) Identify the most likely distribution family.
- b) Estimate the parameter(s) of that distribution from the summary statistics.
- c) For Dataset B, the researcher notices that these are counts of customer complaints per day at a call center. Does this context support your answer? What if instead they were counts of "successes" in 50 independent trials per observation?

## Discrete Distributions

### 04 The "obvious" Bernoulli that isn't {data-difficulty="1"}

A weighted die shows 6 with probability $\frac{1}{3}$ and each of 1–5 with probability $\frac{2}{15}$.

- a) Define a Bernoulli random variable $X$ for "rolling a 6." State $p$ and compute $E[X]$ and $\text{Var}[X]$.
- b) Define a different Bernoulli random variable $Y$ for "rolling an even number." Compute $E[Y]$ and $\text{Var}[Y]$.
- c) For which event is the variance larger? Explain intuitively why maximum Bernoulli variance occurs at $p = 0.5$.

---

### 05 Memoryless waiting: Geometric intuition {data-difficulty="1"}

A slot machine pays out with probability $p = 0.05$ on each play.

- a) What is the expected number of plays until the first payout?
- b) You've already played 50 times with no payout. What is the expected *additional* number of plays until you win?
- c) A gambler says: "I'm due for a win soon because I've lost so many times." In 2–3 sentences, explain why this reasoning is flawed.

---

### 06 Binomial: Quality control decision {data-difficulty="1"}

A factory produces chips with defect probability $p = 0.02$. A batch of $n = 100$ chips is inspected.

- a) Let $X$ be the number of defective chips. State the distribution of $X$ and compute $E[X]$ and $\text{Var}[X]$.
- b) The batch is rejected if more than 5 chips are defective. Without computing $P[X > 5]$ exactly, explain why $P[X > 5]$ is small.
- c) If $p$ increases to $0.10$, recompute $E[X]$. How does this change the rejection decision intuitively?

---

### 07 Poisson: Rare events approximation {data-difficulty="2"}

A website has 10,000 visitors per day. Each visitor independently has a $0.0003$ probability of reporting a bug.

- a) Let $X$ be the number of bug reports per day. Which distribution is a good approximation here, and what is the parameter?
- b) What is the probability of receiving at least one bug report?

---

## Continuous Distributions

### 08 Exponential: Memoryless lifetimes {data-difficulty="2"}

A light bulb's lifetime (in years) follows $\text{Exp}(\lambda = 0.5)$.

- a) Compute $E[X]$ and the probability that the bulb lasts more than 3 years.
- b) Given that the bulb has already lasted 2 years, what is the probability it lasts at least 1 more year?
- c) Compare with the discrete case: if bulb failure each year is Bernoulli with $p = 0.4$, and $Y \sim \text{Geo}(0.4)$ counts years until failure, compute $P[Y > 3 \mid Y > 2]$ and $P[Y > 1]$. What do you notice?

---

### 09 Uniform: The broken stick problem {data-difficulty="2"}

A stick of length 1 is broken at a uniformly random point $X \sim U(0, 1)$.

- a) What is the expected length of the left piece?
- b) Let $Y = X(1 - X)$ be the product of the two piece lengths. Compute $E[Y]$.
- c) What break point $x$ maximizes $Y = x(1-x)$? Compare this to $E[X]$.

---

### 10 Normal: The 68-95-99.7 rule in action {data-difficulty="1"}

Human heights in a population follow $N(170, 100)$ (mean 170 cm, variance 100 cm²).

- a) What is $\sigma$? What proportion of people are between 160 cm and 180 cm tall?
- b) A person is 2.5 standard deviations above the mean. How tall are they?
- c) Standardize the height $X = 155$ cm. Interpret the z-score: is this person unusually short?

---

### 11 Normal: Standardization and comparison {data-difficulty="2"}

Test A has scores $\sim N(500, 10000)$ (so $\sigma = 100$). Test B has scores $\sim N(50, 100)$ (so $\sigma = 10$).

- a) Alice scores 680 on Test A. Bob scores 72 on Test B. Compute both z-scores.
- b) Who performed better relative to their test population?
- c) Explain why comparing raw scores (680 vs 72) is meaningless without standardization.
- d) You're given a coin that shows heads with unknown probability $p$. You flip it 100 times and observe 65 heads. If the coin were fair ($p = 0.5$), what are $E[X]$ and $\text{SD}[X]$ for the number of heads? How many standard deviations away from the mean is 65? What can you conclude about whether $p = 0.5$?

---

## Connections Between Distributions

### 12 The Poisson-Exponential connection {data-difficulty="2"}

Customers arrive at a shop according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda = 4$ per hour.

- a) What distribution does the number of arrivals in 1 hour follow? State its mean and variance.
- b) What distribution does the time between consecutive arrivals follow? State its mean.
- c) If no customer has arrived in the last 15 minutes, what is the probability that the next customer arrives within 10 minutes?

---

### 13 The "inspection paradox" {data-difficulty="3"}

Buses arrive according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda = 6$ per hour (i.e., one every 10 minutes on average). You arrive at the bus stop at a uniformly random time.

- a) What is the distribution of time between consecutive buses? Compute its expected value.
- b) Intuitively, would you expect your average wait time to be 5 minutes (half the inter-arrival time)?
- c) The "inspection paradox" says you're more likely to arrive during a *long* gap than a short one. Without computing, explain in 2–3 sentences why your expected wait might actually be *longer* than 5 minutes.

## Applications and Critical Thinking

### 14 The prosecutor's fallacy: Conditional thinking {data-difficulty="3"}

In a city of 1 million people, a crime is committed. DNA evidence matches the suspect with a 1-in-10,000 error rate (i.e., a random person matches with probability 0.0001).

- a) Model the number of matching individuals in the city as a random variable. What distribution is appropriate? What is its expected value?
- b) The prosecutor argues: "The probability of a false match is 0.0001, so the defendant is 99.99% certain to be guilty." Is this reasoning correct?
- c) If we assume the guilty person is definitely in the city, use Bayes-like reasoning to argue that the suspect's probability of guilt depends on the expected number of matches.
