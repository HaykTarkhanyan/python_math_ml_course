## 1) Expectation & Variance Basics

### 01 Modified Die: Probability and Moments {data-difficulty="1"}
Vahe added a dot on the 4 side of the die, making it 5, and then added two dots on the 1 side, making it 3.

- a) What is the probability that the outcome of the die is greater than 4?
- b) Find the expectation and variance of the modified die.

### 02 Die Game: Expected Value {data-difficulty="1"}
You roll a fair die. If you roll 1, you are paid $25. If you roll 2, you are paid $5. If you roll 3, you win nothing. If you roll 4 or 5, you must pay $10, and if you roll 6, you must pay $15.

- a) Compute the expected payoff.
- b) Do you want to play?

### 03 Uniform Sum Expectation {data-difficulty="3"}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be two continuous random variables with uniform distribution on $(0,2)$.

- Find $\mathbb{E}[X+Y]$.

---


## 2) LOTUS: Law of the Unconscious Statistician

### 04 Expectation Without the CDF {data-difficulty="2"}
Let $X\sim\mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$. Define $Y=\log(1+X)$.

- a) Compute $\mathbb{E}[Y]$ using LOTUS directly.
- b) Compute $\operatorname{Var}(Y)$ (you may leave integrals in closed form).

### 05 Piecewise Payoff {data-difficulty="2"}
Let $X\sim\mathrm{Exp}(\lambda)$. A “refund policy” pays $g(X)=\min(X,c)$ for fixed $c>0$.

(for $\mathrm{Exp}(\lambda)$, $f(x)=\lambda e^{-\lambda x}$ for $x\ge 0$ and $F(x)=1-e^{-\lambda x}$ for $x\ge 0$. Aprikyan will cover distibutions during next or next-next lesson.)

- a) Compute $\mathbb{E}[g(X)]$ using LOTUS.
- b) Compute $\mathbb{P}(g(X)=c)$.
- c) Find $\dfrac{d}{dc}\,\mathbb{E}[g(X)]$ and interpret.


## 3) Expectation & Variance (Decision / Games)

### 06 When to Stop (Secretary-lite) {data-difficulty="3"}
You see prices of used laptops one by one, i.i.d. $\mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$. You can accept one price and stop, or reject and continue; once rejected, it’s gone. You must decide a stopping rule.

- a) Consider the rule: “accept the first price $\le t$.” Compute the expected accepted price as a function of $t$ given a maximum of $N$ offers.
- b) Find (approximately) the best $t$ for $N=10$.

### 07 Optimal Reroll (Single Reroll Allowed) {data-difficulty="2"}
You roll a die once; you may choose to keep it or reroll once (then must keep). Goal: maximize expected value.

- a) What threshold rule is optimal?
- b) What is the resulting expected value?
- c) Compute the variance of the final payoff under the optimal strategy.

### 08 St. Petersburg Game (Bonus) {.bonus-problem data-difficulty="3"}
A fair coin is tossed until the first Heads appears. If Heads appears on toss $k$, you get $2^k$ dollars.

- a) Compute the expected payoff.
- b) Why might people still refuse to pay an “infinite fair price” to play?

## 4) Indicators & Counting (Expectations via Linearity)

### 09 Coupon Collector: Sticker Packs {data-difficulty="3"}
A shop gives one random sticker from a set of $n$ stickers with each purchase (uniform, independent).

- a) Expected number of purchases to collect all $n$ stickers (you may express the answer using harmonic numbers).
- b) For $n=50$, give a rough numerical approximation.

### 10 Distinct Stickers After $n$ Packs: $\mathbb{E}[D]$, $\operatorname{Var}(D)$ {data-difficulty="3"}
You buy $n$ sticker packs; each pack contains one sticker uniformly from $\{1,\dots,m\}$, independent. Let $D$ be the number of distinct stickers you have after $n$ packs.

- a) Find $\mathbb{E}[D]$.
- b) Find $\operatorname{Var}(D)$ using indicators and pairwise terms.

## 5) Inequalities (Markov & Chebyshev)

### 11 Markov — “What’s the chance my bill is huge?” {data-difficulty="2"}
Your monthly electricity bill $B\ge 0$ has average $\mathbb{E}[B]=\$80$.

- a) Use Markov’s inequality to bound $\mathbb{P}(B\ge \$200)$ and $\mathbb{P}(B\ge \$300)$.
- b) Suppose the provider claims: “the probability of a $\$300+$ bill is at most 5%.” What average bill $\mathbb{E}[B]$ would make this statement true by Markov?

### 12 Chebyshev — “Commute-time reliability” {data-difficulty="2"}
Commute time $T$ (minutes) has mean $\mu=40$ and variance $\sigma^2=25$ (so $\sigma=5$).

- a) Use Chebyshev’s inequality to upper-bound $\mathbb{P}(T\ge 55)$ and $\mathbb{P}(T\le 25)$.
- b) How large must a time buffer $b$ be so that $\mathbb{P}(T\le \mu+b)\ge 0.95$?
