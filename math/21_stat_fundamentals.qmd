## 1) Foundations

### 01 Population, Sample, Parameter, Statistic {data-difficulty="1"}
For each scenario, identify the **population**, the **parameter** of interest, the **sample**, and the **statistic** (estimator):

- a) A polling agency surveys 1,200 Armenian voters and reports "58% support policy X." What is the population? Parameter? Sample? Statistic?
- b) A factory tests 100 lightbulbs and finds a mean lifetime of 1,150 hours. What are the four components?
- c) A hospital measures blood pressure in 50 patients and computes the sample mean and standard deviation. Identify all four.

### 02 When Does i.i.d. Break? {data-difficulty="1"}
For each scenario, decide whether the i.i.d. assumption is reasonable. If it breaks, explain **which** part fails (independence, identical distribution, or both):

- a) Measuring the heights of 200 randomly selected adults in Yerevan.
- b) Recording daily stock prices of AAPL over one year.
- c) Surveying customers who voluntarily fill out a feedback form at a restaurant.
- d) Measuring the temperature every hour at a weather station for one week.

### 03 Loss Functions and Optimal Summaries {data-difficulty="2"}
You're predicting tomorrow's temperature for an outdoor event. Suppose the true temperature will be one of $\{18, 19, 20, 21, 22\}$ °C with equal probability.

- a) What single number $a$ minimizes the expected **squared-error** loss $\mathbb{E}[(X - a)^2]$?
- b) What single number minimizes the expected **absolute-error** loss $\mathbb{E}[|X - a|]$?
- c) Now suppose the distribution is $\{18, 19, 20, 21, 50\}$ with equal probability. How do your answers change? Which summary is more robust to the outlier?

### 04 Empirical Risk Minimization {data-difficulty="2"}
Consider the dataset $x_1 = 2, x_2 = 5, x_3 = 5, x_4 = 8, x_5 = 100$.

- a) Compute the empirical risk $\hat{R}(a) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - a)^2$ for $a = \bar{x}$ (the sample mean). What value does the mean take?
- b) Compute the empirical risk under absolute loss $\hat{R}(a) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_i - a|$ for $a = \text{median}$.
- c) Which summary (mean or median) gives a more "typical" value for this dataset? Why?

## 2) Descriptive Statistics

### 05 Summary Statistics Can Mislead {data-difficulty="1"}
Two datasets:

- Dataset A: $\{10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10\}$
- Dataset B: $\{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19\}$

- a) Compute the mean and standard deviation of both datasets.
- b) The means are the same. Are the datasets similar? What statistic reveals the difference?
- c) Sketch a histogram (or describe the shape) of each dataset. What's Dataset B's shape called?

### 06 Boxplots and Outlier Detection {data-difficulty="2"}
A hospital records waiting times (in minutes) for 15 patients:

$$5, 8, 10, 12, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, 35, 45, 120$$

- a) Compute $Q_1$, $Q_2$ (median), $Q_3$, and the IQR.
- b) Using the $1.5 \times \text{IQR}$ rule, identify any outliers.
- c) Compute the mean and median. Which is more appropriate to report as the "typical" waiting time?
- d) If the hospital director removes the 120-minute outlier, how do the mean and median change? Which statistic is more robust?

### 07 Skewness in the Real World {data-difficulty="1"}
For each distribution below, predict whether the skewness is positive, negative, or approximately zero. Briefly justify:

- a) Household incomes in a country.
- b) Heights of adult males.
- c) Exam scores on a very easy test (most students score 90+).
- d) Waiting times at a bus stop.

### 08 Data Visualization & EDA {data-difficulty="2"}
Go over the **Data Visualization** topic:
[https://hayktarkhanyan.github.io/python_math_ml_course/python_libs/06_data_viz.html](https://hayktarkhanyan.github.io/python_math_ml_course/python_libs/06_data_viz.html)

Then pick a dataset (e.g. from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or [armstat.am](http://armstat.am/)) and **explore** it:

- a) Compute summary statistics: mean, median, SD, IQR, skewness for each numeric variable.
- b) Build histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and the ECDF.
- c) Find at least one case where a summary statistic is misleading and a plot reveals the truth.

### 09 Survivorship Bias & Simpson's Paradox {data-difficulty="2"}
Come up with your own real-world examples (not the ones from the lecture!) of:

- a) **Survivorship bias** — where looking only at "survivors" gives a misleading picture.
- b) **Simpson's paradox** — where a trend in aggregated data reverses when split by subgroups.

*Hint: think about social media success stories, historical data, university admission rates, medical treatment outcomes, etc.*

### 10 Anscombe's Quartet: Build Your Own {.bonus-problem data-difficulty="3"}
Construct two small datasets (at least 8 points each) that have:

- The same mean of $x$ and $y$
- The same standard deviation of $x$ and $y$
- The same correlation coefficient

but look completely different when plotted. You can use Python to help tune the numbers.
