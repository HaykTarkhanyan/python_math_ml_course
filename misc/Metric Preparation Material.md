## Projects

We strongly encourage you to work on projects. Pick a dataset/competition from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/), and try to achieve the best result you can. Make sure to also write clean code and publish everything to your GitHub.

Some good datasets to start from are

- [MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer) (handwritten digit recognition)
  - There is also a dataset for Armenian letter recognition called [Mashtots](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mashtots-dataset).
- [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) (classification)
- [Wine Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajyellow46/wine-quality) (classification and EDA)
- [House Price](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) (regression)
- [Personality Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis) (clustering)

For GenAI / NLP, try these

- Fine-tune a small language model (e.g. GPT-2, DistilBERT) on a custom dataset using HuggingFace \[[guide](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/en/chapter3/3)\]
- Build a simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline
- Sentiment analysis or text classification with a pre-trained transformer

# Expected knowledge
